The varying level offense in baseball shows that the value of a hitter's performance can vary considerably depending on the run scoring environment.  E.g. in 2000, a hitter with 30 homeruns wouldn't even sniff the top ten but in 1968 would be near top 5.  And things can change pretty quickly, not just over multiple decades!"
