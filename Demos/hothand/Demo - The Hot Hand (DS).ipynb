The distribution of the statistic when assuming the null hypothesis is sometimes called the _null distribution_.\n",

A weighted coin flip is a coin flip where instead of a 50-50 chance of coming up heads, the coin will come up head with some prescribed probability $p$.  We take the probability as equal to Klay's shooting perentage and the number of heads we get from one simulation will be Klay's made field goal attempts.\n",

    "+ We've lumped together 2s and 3s: if you reran this analysis separating the 2s and 3s, you wouldn't get a different or special view.  Klay shoots about 42% from three so he's already really good and will just have games where the shots fall.\n",
    "+ The statistics do seem on the extreme end and we kind of wrote that off saying that they weren't so extreme to convince us Klay had a special night.  In fact, the story is actually a bit more damning for the hot hand as we'll see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Klay's 60 point game was not one single game but actually just one of many games.  He's had many opportunities to shoot and put up gawdy numbers (~300 since Steve Kerr started coaching for the Warriors).  Given that he's had about 300 opportunities, if we observe a statistic that says it should happen about 1 in 100 times for a random no-hot-hand weighted coin flip player, then it should have happened about 3 times over 300 games.  The fact that Klay has had tons of games in order to put up gawdy numbers means that by picking the most gawdiest, we've accidentally cherry-picked this game and our standard for extremeness needs to be much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's actually look at how often Klay has an extreme looking performance and compare to what would be predicted by the weighted coin flip model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some numbers to put this in context (see cells below for the computation):\n",
    "+ Klay shot 68.4% on 19 two-point attempts in the 60pt game.  From 2014-15 to 2017-18, he had 21 games where he shot at least 15 2-pt shots and in 1 of those (this 60 pt game) he shot at least 68.4%.  In our coin flip model, using his 2-pt pct of 49% and those 21 games, we'd expect about 1 game shooting at least 68.4%.  \n",
    "+ Klay shot 57.1% on 14 three-point attempts in the game.  In that same Kerr-era time span for the Warriors, he had 74 games where he had at least 10 3-pt shot attempts and in 15 of those games he shot at least 57.1% from 3.  In our coin flip model, using his 3-pt pct of 42% and 74 games of 10 3pt attempts, we'd expect about 15 games shooting at least 57.1%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So even though this game was a bit extreme, it was not that extreme compared to other Klay performances.  And when you factor in how often he plays and has an opportunity to have a gawdy shooting night, his performances match up with what'd you expect from a player shooting with weighted coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, he took 33 shots and it's his only game with at least 29 shots.  That's fairly special but is it really that special given that the team was passing the ball to Klay and allowing him to shoot?  This would be like riding out your luck at a casino game.  You perceive a run of luck and decided to keep playing and while the run may last longer than usual, it wasn't anything but a produce of luck.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway: Klay's shooting performances for his career are just not out of line with what we expect from our coin flip model.  "

    "## Does Klay Show a Hot Hand Over a Season?\n",
    "\n",
    "In one of Klay's most stellar games, it appears that any potential hot handedness can be chalked up to luck producing a performance that we as humans think is more extreme or impressive than it actually is. \n",
    "\n",
    "If Klay really has a hot hand effect, he'll routinely show it over the season.  We can try to detect this by looking at Tversky's statistics but computed across all of Klay's games for a season.  Here's an explanation for the setup:\n",
    "1. Take all of Klay's 3pt shots in a given year and look at game's 3pt shot sequence.  We restrict to 3pt shots this time because we want to be a bit more judicious about not mixing different shot results which can have drastically different expected make probabilities.\n",
    "2. For each game, we compute 4 quantities:\n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "    \\#\\{\\text{Streaks of $k+1$ makes in a row}\\},\\ \n",
    "    \\#\\{\\text{Streaks of $k$ makes in a row}\\},\\\\\n",
    "    \\#\\{\\text{Streak of $k$ misses followed by make}\\},\\ \n",
    "    \\#\\{\\text{Streaks of $k$ misses in a row}\\}\n",
    "\\end{gather*}\n",
    "for $k=1, 2, 3$.  We add these to running totals for the Klay's season.\n",
    "3. To generate the null distribution, we take each game's shot sequence and randomly shuffle it 500 times.  For each shuffling we compute the statistics and add to a set of 500 running totals.  This means we keep the number of shots made the same for each game.  Why do we do this instead of using the weighted coin flip model?  We actually could have done this before for Klay's performance but the conclusions wouldn't have changed.  We're using it now because it's easier to implement but is still useful: we've randomized the sequence of shot results holding the number of makes fixed so we can see if there is anything special in the sequencing."

    "## How Easy/Hard is it to Detect a Hot Hand?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've worked hard to try to detect the hot hand, but given that we seem to not have found anything, we should wonder, how hard is it to actually detect a hot hand using the statistics we have been using.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we're going to simulate a hot hand player compared to a non-hot hand player (ie. a weighted coin flip) and compare how the distribution of the statistics to see just how different they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extent that a test statistic can detect an effect is known as _statistical power_ and is incredibly important.  There are three things that drive power: sample size, effect size, quality of the statistic.  We're not dealing with complicated statistics so the last one doesn't really apply.  The first two are always important.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of studies that are reported on in popular press often have tests with very little power and this is often due to small sample sizes.  The importance of power is that if a study has low power but is reporting a result, you should be very suspicious of the result because it's more likely something was done wrong instead of an actual effect being detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating a Hot Hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Tversky's statistic, let's simulate a player that should be well estimated by that statistic.  The normal shooting percentage for the player will be .35 while the hot shooting percentage will be .8.  The player will be hot after two makes in a row.  When the player misses, he reverts to normal.  The player starts the game normal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The seasonal average for this player will be about .45 so that is the shooting percentage we take for the coin flip player.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these values because the difference in shooting between hot and normal is incredibly large.  If we can't detect this, then we're in trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution of Tversky's Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard to Detect: One game\n",
    "\n",
    "I generated 50,000 \"games\" where each player took 14 shots and for each game computed Tversky's statistic for $k=2$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison of the distributions for the hot hand player and the non-hot hand player are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![hot_hand_1.png](hot_hand_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to interpret the histograms is that if we observed a game from a hot hand player, the observed value of the statistic would usually have a value that is entirely plausible from the coin flip player.  This means that it is really hard to distinguish between the hot hand player and the coin flip player.  It's almost assured that we wouldn't be able to detect the hot hand effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, the distribution for the hot hand player would be far to the right of the the coin flip player.  \n",
    "So we see that the effect in an individual game is basically impossible to reliably detect.  The next simulations show easier detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy to Detect: Lots of Games\n",

    "## Summary of the Hot Hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we have determined: a player who has a reputation as a streaky shooter actually has shooting performances which are in line with what we'd expect from a simple weighted coin flip model.  They're also in line with randomized shuffling instead of weighted coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies indicate that recent performance (in baseball, over a 1 week period; in basketball, previous shot attempts) has a small amount predictive power.  In the NBA, an extra make in the previous 4 shots can lead to a 1.2% increase in make percentage.  This demo does not aim to refute those conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, ask yourself this: what do _you_ think of when you hear an announcer say a player is hot?  Compare that to the claims of predictive power from recent performance.  The usual mental model of a hot hand effect is likely not a small uptick in percentage but rather one where a player becomes unstoppable when they're hot.  Observed data does not back up our mental model of hot shooting yet when we look at whether it would even be possible over a season to detect a moderate hot hand effect, we see that Tversky's statistic is in fact pretty powerful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's quite likely that if the effect were to exist, it would either be fairly small so that Tversky's statistic could not detect it, and thus not particularly consequential.  Or it would be large but more specialized and rare and thus more hidden than how it's conventionally been framed (turns on whenever a shooter makes multiple shots). \n",
    "\n",
    "This all goes with a general rule of statistics: if an effect really is there and big, you'll know it because it'll show up in the data and practically be punching you in the face to announce it's presence.  "
