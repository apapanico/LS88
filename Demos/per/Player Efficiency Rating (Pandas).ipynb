Hollinger has described PER as the sum of <a href http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&id=2850240> \"all a player's positive accomplishments, subtracts the negative accomplishments, and returns a per-minute rating of a player's performance.\"</a>\n",

    "\n",
    "The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis so that no player is negatively impcted by lack of playing time. It is also adjusted for pace of play. In the end, PER serves as one number that attempts to create an overall player score.\n"
