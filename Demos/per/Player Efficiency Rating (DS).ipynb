Hollinger has described PER as the sum of <a href http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&id=2850240> \"all a player's positive accomplishments, subtracts the negative accomplishments, and returns a per-minute rating of a player's performance.\"</a>\n",

    "The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis so that no player is negatively impcted by lack of playing time. It is also adjusted for pace of play.
