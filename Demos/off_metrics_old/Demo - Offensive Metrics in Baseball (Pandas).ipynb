    "# Demo - Offensive Metrics in Baseball\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo consists of several parts that will explore offensive metrics for baseball.  We start with the classical statistics and then look at an empirical, data-driven approach to develop improved offensive metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part I explores the classical baseball statistics like _Batting Average_, _On-Base Percentage_, and _Slugging Percentage_, which make up what is commonly known as a batters _Slash Line_ due to how the stats are displayed in order with a / between them.  This part looks at how it relates to team run scoring.  Specifically, we look at how well a statistic correlates with team run scoring to determine how well it serves as a measurement of a team's ability to score runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, we explore the concept of run expectancy and the _Run Expectancy Matrix_, an empirically driven measurement of how many runs we should expect to score in a given out/baserunner state.  We use run expectancy to explore basic baseball strategies like bunting and stealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part III, we use run expectancy to create a valuation of hitting events that occur known as _RE24_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Part IV we use the RE24 values to empirically derive weights or expected values for hitting events known as _Linear Weights_.  We use this to then construct an improved measure of offensive performance known as _wOBA_, Weighted On-Base Average.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, we assume the user is familiar with the usual acronyms, shorthand abbreviations, and definitions of commonly used categories in baseball like BA for Batting Average, 1B for singles, and PA for plate appearances."

    "In this first part, we study the classical baseball statistics that have been used extensively over the years.  We use team-level data from the Lahman Database which is obtainable here in CSV form: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below loads the dataset and performs a few extra operations:\n",
    "+ We restrict to year 2000 and later.  We could take the analysis back further to say 1962 but we definitely should not consider the entire dataset without careful considerations (What happened in 1962 to the schedule? What was baseball like in 1900? What about 1994?).*  \n",
    "+ The dataset does not contain a field for singles so this is easy to compute from the available data as $H - \\mathit{2B} - \\mathit{3B} - \\mathit{HR}$\n",
    "+ $\\mathit{HBP}$ is a field that is not guaranteed to be recorded in the dataset.  After 2000 it is but if you make any modifications in your explorations, you'll want to 0 it out (we know it shouldn't be zero but we have no better option right now).\n",
    "+ Finally, we need to add plate appearances.  The quantity is only an approximate value for PA.  The reason is that there are other baseball events that occur but one unfortunate limitation of the Lahman Database is that it can sometimes have holes like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you like, after working through this part of the notebook rerun the analyses and see what happens if you comment out the year restriction part.  If you know your ancient baseball history, think about the nature of the game at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century and how its different from today."
