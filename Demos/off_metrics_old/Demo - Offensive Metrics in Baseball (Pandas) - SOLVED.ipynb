    "\n",
    "This lab consists of several parts that will explore offensive metrics for baseball.  We start with the classical statistics and then look at an empirical, data-driven approach to develop improved offensive metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part I explores the classical baseball statistics like _Batting Average_, _On-Base Percentage_, and _Slugging Percentage_, which make up what is commonly known as a batters _Slash Line_ due to how the stats are displayed in order with a / between them.  This part looks at how it relates to team run scoring.  Specifically, we look at how well a statistic correlates with team run scoring to determine how well it serves as a measurement of a team's ability to score runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, we explore the concept of run expectancy and the _Run Expectancy Matrix_, an empirically driven measurement of how many runs we should expect to score in a given out/baserunner state.  We use run expectancy to explore basic baseball strategies like bunting and stealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part III, we use run expectancy to create a valuation of hitting events that occur known as _RE24_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Part IV we use the RE24 values to empirically derive weights or expected values for hitting events known as _Linear Weights_.  We use this to then construct an improved measure of offensive performance known as _wOBA_, Weighted On-Base Average.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we assume the user is familiar with the usual acronyms, shorthand abbreviations, and definitions of commonly used categories in baseball like BA for Batting Average, 1B for singles, and PA for plate appearances. "

    "In this first part, we study the classical baseball statistics that have been used extensively over the years.  We use team-level data from the Lahman Database which is obtainable here in CSV form: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below loads the dataset and performs a few extra operations:\n",
    "+ We restrict to year 2000 and later.  We could take the analysis back further to say 1962 but we definitely should not consider the entire dataset without careful considerations (What happened in 1962 to the schedule? What was baseball like in 1900? What about 1994?).*  \n",
    "+ The dataset does not contain a field for singles so this is easy to compute from the available data as $H - \\mathit{2B} - \\mathit{3B} - \\mathit{HR}$\n",
    "+ $\\mathit{HBP}$ is a field that is not guaranteed to be recorded in the dataset.  After 2000 it is but if you make any modifications in your explorations, you'll want to 0 it out (we know it shouldn't be zero but we have no better option right now).\n",
    "+ Finally, we need to add plate appearances.  The quantity is only an approximate value for PA.  The reason is that there are other baseball events that occur but one unfortunate limitation of the Lahman Database is that it can sometimes have holes like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you like, after working through this part of the notebook rerun the analyses and see what happens if you comment out the year restriction part.  If you know your ancient baseball history, think about the nature of the game at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century and how its different from today."

Given the relatively rough form of analysis we are doing, our conclusion shold be that it's not clear and further information about the lineup, the matchups, etc should really dictate the strategy.

We should be using weights we've computed for each year.  The weights do not change too much and you will see some definitions of wOBA used fixed value of weights and changing wOBA_scale values.  For the purposes of this analysis, this should be not be much of an issue as it gets the spirit across and is close enough.\n",

That way we can try to get the best of both worlds in terms of measuring on-base skill and measuring power.\n",

    "We end up finding that OPS and wOBA both do quite well in providing a better association with run scoring.  The correlations are higher and the standard deviation of the errors is much improved.  That said, while both are very similar when we evaluate their performance, there is one reason to prefer wOBA and metrics that are similarly built out of the notion of run expectancy and the linear weights values: they are actually computed in the proper units of runs.  OPS is more or less just a meaningless value that is the sum of two metrics that shouldn't be summed.

    "+ Why does it matter that OBP and SLG correlate with team runs but not completely with each other?\n",
    "+ If we came up with a metric that can perfectly predict team run scoring in the period we have been exploring (post 2000), why should we be suspect of this metric?\n",
    "+ What do you think of the implicit assumption that if a metric works well in measuring team performance that it works well at the player level?  Do you have a problem with the assumpion and if so, why?  If not, give a justification for the assumption.\n",
    "+ What does the Run Expectancy Matrix describe about the nature of baseball?  What can you observe about the difference between second and third base?  How do things change with 2 outs?\n",
    "+ What does run expectancy tell us generally about outs?  That is, how valuable is one extra base compared to an out?\n",
    "+ For a hitter, what is the difference between Total RE24 and Batting Runs/wRAA?  Which one uses the raw, observed values of RE24 and which one replaces those observed, situation depdendent values with average values?  What does it mean for a hitter to have a higher RE24 value than BR/wRAA?  What about lower?\n",
    "+ What does the value of OPS mean to you?  Aside from placing someone's OPS value in relation to other players, does a value of 1.000 mean anything?  How does that compare to wRAA (less so wOBA since the wOBA scale value distorts it)?  If a metric works, why might you prefer not to use it compared to something else?\n",
    "+ What does our analysis say about future performance?  Does it say anything?  Say a player has a .400 wOBA for a season.  What might we want to know about wOBA when evaluating the player and valuing the player's future performance?"
