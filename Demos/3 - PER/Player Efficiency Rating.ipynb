    "John Hollinger was an NBA columnist for ESPN.com for eight years and is currently the Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies. While at ESPN, he coined many advanced metrics in order to quantify player and team performance, such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Offensive Efficiency, Defensive Efficiency and Pace Factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "PER is a rating of a player’s per-minute statistical performance that Hollinger developed to make player comparisons easier, and has become a widely used standard over the past decade. Hollinger has described PER as the sum of <a href http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&id=2850240> \"all a player's positive accomplishments, subtracts the negative accomplishments, and returns a per-minute rating of a player's performance.\"</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As PER attempts to be an all-encompassing number that looks at positive accomplishments, such as field goals, free throws, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and negative results, such as missed shots, turnovers and fouls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis so that no player is negatively impcted by lack of playing time. It is also adjusted for pace of play. In the end, PER serves as one number that attempts to create an overall player score.\n"
